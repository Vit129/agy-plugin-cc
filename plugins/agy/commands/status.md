If the user did not pass a job ID:
- Render the command output as a single Markdown table for the current and past runs in this session.
- Keep it compact. Do not include extra prose outside the table.
- Preserve the actionable fields: job ID, kind, status, phase, elapsed or duration, summary, and follow-up commands.

If the user did pass a job ID:
- Present the full command output to the user.
- Do not summarize or condense it.
